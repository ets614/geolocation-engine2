# Interview Guide - AI Detection to COP Translation

## Discovery Goal
Validate whether teams integrating AI object detection with Common Operating Picture (COP) systems have unmet pain points in translating detection outputs to COP-compatible formats and visualizations.

## Interview Objectives
1. Understand current workflows for handling AI detection data
2. Map the gap between what detection systems output and what COP systems need
3. Identify decision factors for solution adoption
4. Find the actual jobs-to-be-done (not just the stated problem)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Don't pitch the solution or accept "that would be great"
- Don't ask "would you use this if...?"
- Do ask about current workarounds and past struggles
- Do seek specific examples with dates and names
- Do listen for inconsistencies between stated needs and actual behavior

## Interview Questions (Sequenced by Mom Test)

### Warm-up (Build context)
1. What does a typical day/week look like for your team around data visualization or operations?
2. Can you walk me through the last time your team needed to get detection data from sensors onto your operations dashboard?

### Problem Investigation
3. What happened specifically? [Dig into: What data? Which systems? What did it take?]
4. What made that difficult? [Listen for: Manual steps, format translation, data loss, delays]
5. How do you currently handle the translation from detection outputs to your operations picture?
6. What's the biggest time sink or source of errors in that process?

### Commitment / Evidence
7. When you ran into this issue last time, what did you actually do to work around it?
8. Did you hire anyone, build something custom, or pay for a tool to solve this?
9. How long does that step actually take? [Get specific numbers]
10. Who else on your team hits this problem? Have you talked to them about solutions?

### Close (No pitch)
11. What would need to change for you to feel like this problem is solved?
12. If I were building something to help with this, what should I definitely know?

## Segmentation Capture
- Role: [end user, operations manager, data analyst, integrations specialist, other]
- Context: [military/defense, law enforcement, emergency response, logistics, other]
- Current system: [TAK, ATAK, other COP platform]
- Data sources: [UAV, satellite, CCTV, radar, other sensors]
- Team size: [solo, small team 2-5, medium 5-20, large 20+]
- Current workaround complexity: [none/manual/custom script/commercial tool]

## Success Criteria for Interview
- ✓ Specific past example discussed (not hypothetical)
- ✓ Natural pain point mentioned (not leading)
- ✓ Commitment signal detected (hired, bought, custom build, or follow-up meeting)
- ✓ Customer's own language captured for problem articulation
- ✓ Decision factor or blocker identified
